The head of engineering would joke about me ""doing meth"" after that at horrible moments including me (I have no degree) interviewing a PhD candidate who had done groundbreaking work in SMP and threaded rendering at SGI in the 90s and was all around awesome.  Luckily he made a joke about not talking about the shrooms he did to lighten that one, but there were many worse situations.  I was considered one of the most valued employees because of my ability to get anything done with the LLVM compiler system.  One day I pointed out to the manager in question that he was on a higher dosage of the same medication I was on, and the stupid meth jokes got worse from there.  It's not really a light accusation to make on somebody given our country's state of drug law, something which I am something of an activist for reform of.  It was was degrading.
